# University App USOS version 1.0

Inspired by existing university apps and as a student myself, I wanted to create my own app that includes a clean interface, animations, essential features, and tools to make a student’s life easier.  

> **Note:** This is the first version of the app, still in development. Currently, only the main screens, design, and core logic are implemented. Many features are planned but not yet available.

## Features

### 1. Main Screen
- Displays the most important information at a glance:
  - Schedule for today
  - University news
  - Grades and marks
- Quick access to other sections of the app
